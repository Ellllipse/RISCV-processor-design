# RISCV-processor-design

This project has included a general modified version of RISCV pipelined processor and a version for Tower of Hanoi simulation. 

The RISCV code is written in SystemVerilog and tested using test files in ModelSim. 

I have included two PDF files that explained my design: one is the general walkthrough of the pipeline strategy and the other one is the solution of the Tower of Hanoi simulation.
